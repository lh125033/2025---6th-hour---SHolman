#A common exercise in computer science is "FizzBuzz". The rules of
#the game are simple. Count from 1 to 100 but with every number that
#is divisible by 3 you say "Fizz" instead of the number,
#every number divisible by 5 you say "Buzz" instead,
#and if it's divisible by both you say "FizzBuzz".

#Create a while loop that follows the rules of the game.

i = 1

while i <= 100:
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("Fizzbuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
    i += 1
