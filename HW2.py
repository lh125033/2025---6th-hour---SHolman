#2. Create three different variables with distinct names and values: one with an integer, one with a string, one with a boolean.
nice_to_meet = "Hello, what's your name?"
entered_number = 10
true_false = True
#3. Print all three variables on the same print function (at the same time).
print(nice_to_meet, entered_number, true_false)
#4. Create a variable that asks the user to input an integer.
ask_number = int(input("What's your favorite number? "))
#5. Add the integer variable from #2 with the integer from #4 and print the result.
number_number = entered_number + ask_number
print(number_number)
#6. Take the result from #5 and divide it by 2. Print the result.
print(number_number / 2)
#7. Change the value of the boolean variable to the opposite value (if true then make false, or vice versa).
true_false = False
#8. Print the value of the boolean variable.
print(true_false)
#9. Create a variable with a number that contains decimals.
decipoint = 20.5
#10. Round the number from #9 up or down using the round function.
print(round(decipoint))
